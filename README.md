# Let's Code in R - Contents
This repository is intended to contain all the material related to the training sessions, e.g. slides, code, exercices and so on. You should feel free to contribute by correcting any mistakes or adding your own examples discussed during sessions.

## Overall organization

The way things are organized is really basic: **a folder for each week** and **a Misc folder for transversal material**, e.g. CRAN repo configuration, SWIRL install, etc.

It was agreed that **once every 2 weeks new material will be introduced**. The week inbetween should allow us to get familiar and practice the new stuff and mix it up with some old one.

At some point, we will start a **common project** and split the coding between programmers so you experience what collaborative coding is like. For now it is too early to tell when we will start. But you can still start thinking about the subject of this common challenge.

## What did we do so far ?

Here is a **quick overview** of what we've done so far and where we currently stand:

* **Week1**: Get familiar with R/RStudio/Git. What's a variable ? How to create variables ?
* **Week2**: Manipulating variable (Practice session)
* **Week3**: Control structures: if-else, for and while loops.
* **Week4**: Using control structures in basic examples (Practice session)
* **Week5**: How do I define a custom function ? Further examples on control structures. (Practice session)
* **Week6**: How to get things in and out of my program ?
* **Week7**: (Practice session)
* **Week8**: Data visualisation: 2d plot, 3d plot, leaflet, word cloud, network.
* **Week9**: (Practice session using 2d/3d plot, leaflet still needs to be fixed)
* **Week10**: (Practice session)
* **Week11**: First steps with shiny
* **Week12**: (Practice session)
* **Week13**: Introduction to shiny dashboards
* **Week14**: (Challenge session) Start working on a common challenge and split code among trainees.
* **Week15**: (Challenge session) ...
* **Week16**: (Challenge session) ...

This is it: The end of the 'Let's Code' first session. The next step for each trainee is to find a way to continue their learning path - maybe not in R - by using MOOC (like coursera) or by participating to coding projects (e.g. open source on GitHub) or coding events.
