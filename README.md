# Let's Code Contents
This repository contains all the material, e.g. slides, code, exercices and so on for the training sessions.

At the moment, the way things are organized is really basic: a folder for each week and a Misc folder for transversal material, e.g. CRAN repo configuration, SWIRL install, etc.

It was agreed that once every 2 weeks new material will be introduced. The week inbetween should allow us to get familiar and practice the new stuff and mix it up with some old one.

At some point, we will start a common project and split the coding between programmers. For now it is too early to tell when we will start. But you can still start thinking about the subject of this common project.
