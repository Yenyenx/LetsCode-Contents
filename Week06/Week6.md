Getting Data In and Out of R
========================================================
class: small-code

Getting data in and out of your program is really soemthing common. The inverse, i.e. coding a program with no data getting either in or out, is nowadays pretty rare... unless some very specific stuff like mathematical algorithm...

Multiple use cases:
* data are available **on your computer locally** or through **local network**,
* data are available through **R repositories** => reference dataset,
* data is stored in outside world...: classic web or API or...

But first of all, let us learn how to manipulate a single file or a folder using R.

Basic file manipulation (1/3)
========================================================
class: small-code

File manipulation in R:
* **file.create**(..., showWarnings = TRUE) : creates files with the given names if they do not already exist and truncates them if they do. They are created with the maximal read/write permissions.


```r
file.create("HelloWorld.txt", showWarnings = T)
```

```
[1] TRUE
```

```r
file.create(c("File1.txt", "File2.txt"), showWarnings = T)
```

```
[1] TRUE TRUE
```

* **file.exists**(...) :  returns a logical vector indicating whether the files exist. (Here *exists* is in the sense of the system's stat call: a file will be reported as existing only if you have the permissions needed.)


```r
file.exists("HelloWorld.txt")
```

```
[1] TRUE
```

```r
file.exists("Blabla.txt")
```

```
[1] FALSE
```

**NB:** the existence of a file does not imply that it is readable.

Basic file manipulation (2/3)
========================================================
class: small-code

* **file.rename**(from, to) : 

```r
file.rename("File1.txt", "File1.csv")
```

```
[1] TRUE
```

* **file.copy**(from, to, overwrite = recursive, recursive = FALSE, copy.mode = TRUE, copy.date = FALSE) :

```r
file.copy(from="File2.txt", to="File3.txt")
```

```
[1] TRUE
```

Basic file manipulation (3/3)
========================================================
class: small-code

* **file.remove**(...) : attempts to remove the files named in its argument. On Windows, *file* means a regular file and not, say, an empty directory.

```r
file.remove("File3.txt")
```

```
[1] TRUE
```

* **file.info(...)**,
* **file.access(...)**.

**NB:** All these methods are available in base package.

A first basic example
========================================================
class: small-code


```r
if(file.create("BasicExample.txt")) {
  fileConn <- file("BasicExample.txt")
  writeLines("First Basic Example", fileConn)
  close(fileConn)  
}

if(file.exists("BasicExample.txt")) {
  if(!file.copy("BasicExample.txt", "BasicExample2.txt")) {
    warning("file not properly copied!")
  }
}

if(file.exists("BasicExample.txt") & file.exists("BasicExample2.txt")) {
  if(!file.append("BasicExample.txt", "BasicExample2.txt")){
    warning("Appending data to file went wrong!")
  }
}

if(file.exists("BasicExample.txt")) {
  content <- readLines(fileConn <- file("BasicExample.txt"))
  print(content)
  close(fileConn)  
}
```

```
[1] "First Basic Example" "First Basic Example" "End of file"        
```

```r
if(file.exists("BasicExample.txt")) {
  if(!file.remove("BasicExample.txt")) {
    warning("File not properly removed!")
  }
}
```

Basic folder manipulation
========================================================
class: small-code

folder manipulation:
* **list.files()**: produce a character vector of the names of files or directories in the named directory.
* **getwd()**: returns an absolute filepath representing the current working directory of the R process.
* **setwd(**dir**)**: used to set the working directory to *dir*.
* **dir.create(**path**)**: creates a new directory.
* **dir.exists(**paths**)**: checks if a list of directories exist.

A first basic example
========================================================
class: small-code


```r
list.files()
```

```
 [1] "BasicExample2.txt" "data.R"            "demo.html"        
 [4] "File1.csv"         "File2.txt"         "HelloWorld.txt"   
 [7] "mydata.rda"        "mydata.RData"      "Runners.csv"      
[10] "serial_x.txt"      "Test.xls"          "Test.xlsx"        
[13] "Week6.html"        "Week6.Rpres"       "y.R"              
```

```r
list.dirs()
```

```
[1] "."
```

Reading data into R
========================================================
class: small-code

There are a few principal functions reading data into R:

* **read.table**, **read.csv**, for reading tabular data ;
* **readLines**, for reading lines of a text file
* **source**, for reading in R code files (inverse of dump)
* **dget**, for reading in R code files (inverse of dput)
* **load**, for reading in saved workspaces
* **unserialize**, for reading single R objects in binary form.

There are of course, many R packages to read in all kinds of other datasets, and you may need to resort to one of these if you are working in a specific area.


Reading data from MS Excel files
========================================================
class: small-code


```r
library(openxlsx)
df <- read.xlsx("Test.xlsx", sheet= 1, startRow= 1, colNames = T)
str(df)
```

```
'data.frame':	4 obs. of  2 variables:
 $ Name: chr  "Adrien" "Bob" "Adrien" "Bob"
 $ Dist: num  10 45 20 42
```

```r
library(readxl)
df <- read_excel("Test.xls", sheet= 1)
str(df)
```

```
Classes 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':	4 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ Name: chr  "Adrien" "Bob" "Adrien" "Bob"
 $ Dist: num  10 45 20 42
 $ Unit: chr  "km" "km" "miles" "km"
```

Using the readr Package
========================================================
class: small-code

The readr package is developed by **Hadley Wickham** to deal with reading in large flat files. It provides replacements for functions like read.table() and read.csv(). The analogous functions in *readr* are **read_table()** and **read_csv()**. These are oven much faster than their *base* R analogues and provide a few other nice features.





```r
library(readr)
runners <- read_csv2(file = "Runners.csv",
                     col_names = TRUE,
                     trim_ws = TRUE)
str(runners)
```

```
Classes 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':	1000000 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ Name    : chr  "Janine" "Janine" "Adrien" "Janine" ...
 $ Distance: int  20 70 10 45 70 10 70 10 20 45 ...
 $ Unit    : chr  "km" "m" "miles" "miles" ...
 - attr(*, "spec")=List of 2
  ..$ cols   :List of 3
  .. ..$ Name    : list()
  .. .. ..- attr(*, "class")= chr  "collector_character" "collector"
  .. ..$ Distance: list()
  .. .. ..- attr(*, "class")= chr  "collector_integer" "collector"
  .. ..$ Unit    : list()
  .. .. ..- attr(*, "class")= chr  "collector_character" "collector"
  ..$ default: list()
  .. ..- attr(*, "class")= chr  "collector_guess" "collector"
  ..- attr(*, "class")= chr "col_spec"
```

Using Binary Formats for Storing Data (1/4)
========================================================
class: small-code

One way to pass data around is by deparsing the R object with **dput()** and reading it back in (parsing it) using **dget()**.


```r
y <- data.frame(a = 1, b = "a")
dput(y, file="y.R")
new.y <- dget("y.R")
new.y
```

```
  a b
1 1 a
```

Multiple objects are *deparsed* at once using **dump** and read back in using **source**.


```r
x <- "foo"
y <- data.frame(a = 1L, b = "a")

dump(c("x", "y"), file = "data.R")

source("data.R")
str(y)
```

```
'data.frame':	1 obs. of  2 variables:
 $ a: int 1
 $ b: Factor w/ 1 level "a": 1
```

```r
str(x)
```

```
 chr "foo"
```

Using Binary Formats for Storing Data (2/4)
========================================================
class: small-code

The complement to **textual** format is **binary** format, which is sometimes necessary to use for efficiency purposes, or because there s just no useful way to represent data in a textual manner. 

With numeric data, one can *often* lose precision when converting to and from a textual format, so it s better to stick with a binary format.

The key functions for converting R objects into a binary format are **save()**, **save.image()**, and **serialize()**. Individual R objects can be saved to a file using the **save()** function.


```r
a <- data.frame(x = rnorm(100), y = runif(100))
b <- c(3, 4.4, 1 / 3)
save(a, b, file = "mydata.rda")
load("mydata.rda")
```

Using Binary Formats for Storing Data (3/4)
========================================================
class: small-code

If you have a lot of objects that you want to save to a file, you can save all objects in your workspace using the save.image() function.


```r
## Save everything to a file
save.image(file = "mydata.RData")

## load all objects in this file
load("mydata.RData")
```

**NB**: Using *.rda* extension when using **save()** and the *.RData* extension when using **save.image()** is not at all mandatory. This is just common practice, since .rda and .RData are fairly common extensions and are recognized by other software.

Using Binary Formats for Storing Data (4/4)
========================================================
class: small-code

The **serialize()** function is used to convert individual R objects into a binary format that can be communicated across an arbitrary connection. This may get sent to a file, but it could get sent over a network or other connection.

The output of **serialize** will be a raw vector coded in hexadecimal format.


```r
x <- list(1,2,3)
serialize(x, NULL)
```

```
 [1] 58 0a 00 00 00 02 00 03 03 02 00 02 03 00 00 00 00 13 00 00 00 03 00
[24] 00 00 0e 00 00 00 01 3f f0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0e 00 00 00 01
[47] 40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0e 00 00 00 01 40 08 00 00 00 00 00
[70] 00
```

```r
con <- file("serial_x.txt", "w")
serialize(x,con)
```

```
NULL
```

```r
close(con)

con <- file("serial_x.txt", "r")
x.new <- unserialize(con)
close(con)
x.new
```

```
[[1]]
[1] 1

[[2]]
[1] 2

[[3]]
[1] 3
```

This can be sent to a file, but in that case you are better off using something like **save()**. The benefit of the serialize() function is that it is the only way to perfectly represent an R object in an exportable format, without losing precision or any metadata.


Interfaces to the Outside World
========================================================
class: small-code

Data are read in using connection interfaces. Connections can be made to files (most common) or to other more exotic things.

- file, opens a connection to a file (Already done above...)
- gzfile, opens a connection to a file compressed with gzip (kind of an extension of file)
- bzfile, opens a connection to a file compressed with bzip2 (kind of an extension of file)
- url, opens a connection to a webpage.

A first example with an URL
========================================================
class: small-code


```r
con <- url("http://www.jhsph.edu", "r")
x <- readLines(con = con)
head(x)
```

```
[1] "<!DOCTYPE html>"                                               
[2] "<html lang=\"en\">"                                            
[3] ""                                                              
[4] "<head>"                                                        
[5] "<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />"                                    
[6] "<title>Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health</title>"
```

```r
con <- url("http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris")
x <- readLines(con = con)
head(x,12)
```

```
 [1] "<!DOCTYPE html>"

A second example using RCurl (1/2)
========================================================
class: small-code

First have a look at <https://opendata.paris.fr/>. It's a website dedicated to data related to the city Paris. These data are accessible through many ways. One of them is uploading a csv file. 

**We here automate the task of uploading a specific file from the website and transforming it into a data.frame for further use in our own specific program**.

A second example using RCurl (2/2)
========================================================
class: small-code


```r
library(RCurl) #getURL
# options(RCurlOptions = list(proxy = "http://%YOUR%PROXY%GOES%HERE%", 
#                             proxyport = 8080))
# # The true proxy used in the code in hidden.
```
